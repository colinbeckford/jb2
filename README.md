# jb2

"Jb2" is a Scales Collective collaboration on making an optimal yo-yo freestyle clicker.

Created through Java Swing Designer, this frame application serves as a clicker for the technical portion of yo-yo routines, but also has extra data points such as the percentage of total clicks that were given as "+2" difficult clicks, the clicks per second at the end of the routine, and even an exported CSV of the seconds that the user gave +1, +2, or -1. 

In order for this program for work, here are a set of instructions:
IN THE CODE - 
Edit the fileWriter in line 260 to enter your preferred location for the final CSV file.
IN THE PROGRAM - 
1) Enter in the judge name, player name, youtube link, and competition/round of the performance into the texts boxes. 
2) Press the submit button.
3) Press enter when the music of the yo-yo freestyle starts. This executes the timer.
4) Press the "1" key to award a +1 click, the "2" key for clicking a difficult element (awarded 2 clicks), and the "-" key to deduct 1 click (-1) throughout the performance.
5) When the freestyle is over, press the "0" key to stop the timer and view your results. While this is happening, the CSV file will be exported to your preferred location, written in the code. 
6) Press the backspace/delete button to reset all data, and close the app. Currently, the application can not be used multiple times in a row, it must be restarted.
